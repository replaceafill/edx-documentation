.. _Differentiated Content Overview:

#######################################################
Offering Different Content to Different Learner Groups
#######################################################

You can design your course so that some learners are given different content
than others, based on the group that they belong to. Learners can be grouped
either by cohort, or, if your course has more than one enrollment track, by the
enrollment track that learners join for your course.

This section provides information about offering differentiated content in
your course.

.. note:: You can also use experiment groups to compare the performance of
   groups of learners who are offered different content. For details, see
   :ref:`Overview of Content Experiments`.

*********************************************************************
Offering Different Content to Learners in Different Enrollment Tracks
*********************************************************************

If your course has more than one enrollment track, you can designate specific
components as being available to learners in each of the enrollment tracks.

For example, you might provide the same content to all learners in a section
but might give one exam to learners in the audit track and another exam for
learners in the verified certificate track.

For information about creating differentiated content based on enrollment
track, see :ref:`Enrollment Track Specific Courseware Overview`.


***********************************************************
Offering Different Content to Learners in Different Cohorts
***********************************************************

If you have enabled cohorts in your course, you can use content groups to
designate particular components in your course as visible only to learners in
a specific cohort.

For example, you might intend all learners in your course to have
substantially the same course experience, except that you want to show
learners who are either current students or alumni of your university a
special videos in several sections. By creating a cohort for these university-
related learners and designating the special video as only visible to this
cohort, you can provide a customized course experience.

For information about creating differentiated content using cohorts, see
:ref:`Cohorts Overview` and :ref:`Cohorted Courseware Overview`.
