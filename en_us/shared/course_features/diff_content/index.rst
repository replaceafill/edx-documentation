.. _Offering Differentiated Content:

#######################################################
Offering Different Content to Different Learner Groups
#######################################################

You can design your course so that some learners are given different content
than others, based on the group that they belong to. Learners can be grouped
either by cohort, or, if your course has more than one enrollment track, by the
enrollment track that learners join for your course.

This section provides information about offering differentiated content in
your course.

.. note:: You can also use experiment groups to compare the performance of
   groups of learners who are offered different content. For details, see
   :ref:`Overview of Content Experiments`.
